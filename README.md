Valuation model of used Thinkpads sold on eBay

Just a multiple linear regression model with categorical and continuous variables.
Ended up using the model, cpu type and generation, condition, hard-drive and RAM to
evaluate each computer. 

Ended up buying a machine at around $100 less than its market value through a 
'make an offer' sale.
